    <p>Unfortunately, both the Windows and MacOS versions are currently both broken, the Windows version should be fixed in about a week, but the MacOS version will take much, much longer to fix.</p>
   <h1>All Downloads</h1>
  <p>Some downloads have Java embedded within them. Others do not. If you download any release that does not have Java embedded, you must download an <a href="https://adoptium.net">OpenJDK Binary</a> to run it.
</p>
  <p>The Program-Only releases are much smaller and will download faster</p>
  <p>The links that say "direct download" download from a fast cloudflare server instead of the slow files.fm server.</p>
<h1>Java-Embedded Releases</h1>

<h1>MacOS Versions</h1>
  <p>MacOS has a new Gatekeeper system that effectively renders the program useless, I have not been able to find the reason behind this. To run pac-man, you must disable Gatekeeper. 
  PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK: to disable Gatekeeper, open Terminal and type `sudo spctl --master-disable`, you will need to have admin privlages to proceed. DISABLING GATEKKEEPER LEAVES YOUR MAC MORE VULNERABLE TO POTENTIAL VIRUSES. PROCEED WITH CAUTION.</p>
  
  <p><span style="color:#FF0800">To run Pac-Man, without disabling Gatekeeper, you must open "application.macosx", control-click "Pac_Man.app", click "Show Package Contents", open the "Contents" folder, and finally  open the "MacOS" folder and double-click the file inside it. Please email me at help@getpacman.gq if you encounter any problems.</span></p>

  <P>I am not responsible for any negative impacts of disabling Gatekeeper. Disable Gatekeeper entirely at your own risk.</P>
