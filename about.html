  <p>I am a high school student living in Canada</p>
  <p>I love cats, woodworking, coding, fixing stuff, walking, and being in nature.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I work with wood and metal, take stuff apart, scavenge, fix stuff, make stuff, code, learn about Linux, and go for walks.</p>
  <h2>About Pac-Man</h2>
  <p>I started Pac-Man when I was ~10 as a Hatch Coding project and it just kind-of improved from there. The original version was really bad, but over time I made many improvements to it and now it is very well done. Then, during the summer of 2022, I converted the Processing.JS to Processing 4.2(Java). Now, I have converted the Processing code to pure Java. I have now discovered why the sound was broken on Linux, among many other issues. (It turns out I forgot to close files after opening them, like literally every single time.)</p>
