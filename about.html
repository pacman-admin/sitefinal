  <h1> About me</h1>
  <p>I am a 14 year old living in Ontario, Canada</p>
  <p>I love cats, woodworking, coding, fixing stuff, walking, and being in nature.</p>
  <p>I am in the Mississauga Children's Choir and love to sing.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I work with wood and metal, take stuff apart, scavenge, fix stuff, make stuff, code , and go for walk.</p>
  <h2>About Pac-Man</h2>
  <p>I started Pac-Man when I was ~10 as a Hatch Coding project and it just kind-of improved from there. The original version was really bad, but over time I made many improvements to it and now it is very well done. Then, during the summer of 2022, I converted the ProcessingJS to Processing 4.0(Java). Now, I am converting the Processing code to pure Java. I am working on an auto-update feature for it.</p>
